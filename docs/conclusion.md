# Conclusion

We hope you'll join us on our journey to establish a decentralized web3 community protocol. We believe web3 communities should work towards [sufficient decentralization](https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks) and not be locked up by web2 centralization and extraction. An ambitious protocol such as ours won't be an overnight effort, and will require effort from everyone, including you!
